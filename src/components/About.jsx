        I'm currently in my penultimate year pursuing a double degree in
        Mechatronics Engineering and Business at McMaster University. Throughout
        my degree, I have gained almost two years of experience working multiple
        software developer internships. My passion lies in developing innovative
        solutions and increasing efficiency through optimized pipelines and
        workflows, which I believe can add value to any organization. I am also
        interested in areas such as data analytics, machine learning, AI, and
        the fintech industry, particularly with quantitative analysis and
        algorithmic trading.

        In my free time, I enjoy staying active by working out and playing
        sports. I am a fan of Formula 1 racing and am fascinated by the complex
        engineering of the cars. As a software developer, I am always eager to
        explore new technologies and collaborate with others. I have
        participated in several hackathons as both a participant and executive
        organizer. I also have leadership experience as a project manager for
        the McMaster Rocketry Team, where I oversaw planning and integration of
        the first successful high-powered rocket launch our University has ever
        had! Check out our 3km (10,000ft){" "}
